1. Jupyter Notebook (sales_analysis.ipynb)

    Import, clean, and preprocess the dataset.

    Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.

    Compute KPIs:

    Total revenue

    Total orders

    Average order value

    Month-over-month (MoM) revenue growth

    Create visuals (with Matplotlib/Seaborn):

    Monthly revenue trend (line chart)

    Top 10 products by revenue (bar chart)

    Category contribution (pie/bar)

    Revenue by city (bar chart)

    Online vs In-Store revenue comparison (bar/stacked chart)

    Each chart must include title, labels, and short interpretation.


2. Excel File (sales_dashboard.xlsx)

    Pivot table: Revenue by city & channel.

    Pivot table: Revenue by product category.

    Add slicers (filters) for: Month & Category.

    A summary sheet with total revenue, orders, AOV.

3. Power BI Dashboard (sales_dashboard.pbix)

    Page 1: Overview → KPIs(Total revenue, Total orders, Average order value, Month-over-month (MoM) revenue growth) + Monthly Revenue Trend.

    Page 2:      → Top 10 Products, Category Share.

    Page 3: Geography & Channel → Revenue by City, Online vs. In-Store.

    Must be interactive (filters for month/category).

4. Postgres SQL Script (sales_queries.sql)

    Table schema for the dataset.

    Load script (COPY/INSERT to populate).

    At least 5 queries:

        Monthly revenue by city

        Top 10 products by revenue

        Orders per sales channel

        Average order value per category

        Month-over-month revenue growth

5. Executive Summary (executive_summary.pdf or .docx)

    3-4 bullet points with main findings (e.g., “Karachi Online channel contributed 40% of sales”).

    1 chart (most powerful visualization, like revenue trend).

    1 recommendation for management (e.g., “Invest more in online marketing for Karachi since it has the highest AOV”).
